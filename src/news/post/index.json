        "content": " What is a Package Manager A package manager or package-management system is a collection of software tools that automates the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing computer programs for a computer\u0026rsquo;s operating system in a consistent manner.1 Many modern package managers can also send compressed packages(reduces download time and bandwidth), give packages checksums and sign them(improves security), and use third-party repositories(more programs).\nWhat is Rust Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety.2 Rust provides memory safety without a garbage collector, has an awesome build system called cargo, and makes writing platform agnostic way super easy. A member of MSRC(Microsoft Security Response Center) mention in a presentation that \u0026ldquo;70 percent of the vulnerabilities Microsoft assigns a CVE each year continue to be memory safety issues.\u0026rdquo;3 Using rust means less time doing bug fixes and more time making the package manager and new features.\nWhat are the Goals of Neo Neo is still very very VERY early in development so not all of these goals have begun to be implemented(or started) but here is a list of features I plan implementing for Neo.\n Packages are downloaded, installed, and removed in parrallel Only update files that change (via hash checking) Use zstd compression (faster downloads) Serve and download over Rustls When installing program don\u0026rsquo;t block user request to install another program (add it to queue) Third party repository system similiar to AUR Source code build system similiar to gentoo\u0026rsquo;s Be platform agnostic(A different repo for every kernel) Resume partial package install/updates Check package integrity: missing files, hashes, missing or unresolved (reverse)dependencies, dangling or modified symlinks, etc  But I Don\u0026rsquo;t Want to Learn a New Syntax To make it easier for user\u0026rsquo;s to switch to Neo OS from another unix operating system Neo will adopt multiple arguemnts for the same function.\n   Install package Remove package Update All     neo -S package neo -Rs package neo -Syu package   neo add package neo del package neo update package   neo install package neo uninstall package neo upgrade package   neo get package neo rm package neo up package     \u0026ldquo;Archived Copy\u0026rdquo; Archived from the original on 17 October 2017.
